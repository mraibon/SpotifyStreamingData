# Spotify Streaming Data

## Objective
Collect and analyze my Spotify streaming data to determine what artists, songs, and albums I listen to most. Also to see what times, days, and months I listen to music the most. 

Overall, this was just a fun project to see my listening habits.

## Dataset
I requested my entire listening history from Spotify, who sent the data in JSON format. The data included artist name, song name, album name, and song listening day and time.

## Tools
Visualization: [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/2023SpotifyStreaming/SpotifyData?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Tableau

I imported the JSON files into Tableau. Because there were multiple files (with the same format), I performed a union in Tableau and began creating visualizations. Due to the amount of data, my final analysis only includes my Spotify data from 2023.

### Observations
* May and November 2023 were huge traveling months so it makes sense why they were my highest listening months!
* It's hard to believe that nearly 2% of my 2023 was dedicated to listening to music.
* I wasn't aware I was a huge Drake fan, but alas.

### Observations
* Initially, I was surprised that I nearly listened to music at every hour of the day - however, I do consume music sometimes to fall asleep or to even to wake up and I very likely had days where I slept late or woke up early. So, now I'm surprised every time slot isn't full!
